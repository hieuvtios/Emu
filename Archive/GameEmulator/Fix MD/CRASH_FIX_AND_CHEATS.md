## Overview

Fixed `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` crash when saving/loading states and added built-in cheat database with Street Fighter 2 SNES cheats.

## 🐛 Crash Fix: EXC_BAD_ACCESS on Save State

### Problem
```
Thread 1: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=2, address=0x105394000)
```
This crash occurred when saving or loading game states because the emulator core was being accessed while it was actively running, causing memory access violations.

### Root Cause
The save/load state operations were attempting to access emulator memory while:
1. The emulator was actively running
2. Multiple threads were accessing the same memory
3. No synchronization was in place

### Solution
Added pause/resume logic around save/load operations in `SaveStateManager.swift`:

#### Save State Fix
```swift
func saveState(for game: Game, emulatorCore: EmulatorCore, slotNumber: Int, screenshot: UIImage?) -> Result<SaveStateInfo, Error> {
    // Pause emulator before saving to prevent crashes
    let wasPaused = emulatorCore.state == .paused || emulatorCore.state == .stopped
    if !wasPaused {
        emulatorCore.pause()
    }

    // Save the actual emulator state
    let saveState = PersistentSaveState(fileURL: saveStateInfo.saveStateURL, gameType: game.type)
    try emulatorCore.saveGameState(to: saveState.fileURL)

    // Resume if it was running before
    if !wasPaused && emulatorCore.state == .paused {
        emulatorCore.resume()
    }

    // ... rest of save logic
}
```

#### Load State Fix
```swift
func loadState(_ saveStateInfo: SaveStateInfo, emulatorCore: EmulatorCore) -> Result<Void, Error> {
    // Pause before loading to prevent crashes
    let wasRunning = emulatorCore.state == .running
    if wasRunning {
        emulatorCore.pause()
    }

    try emulatorCore.loadGameState(from: saveStateInfo.saveStateURL)

    // Resume if it was running before
    if wasRunning {
        emulatorCore.resume()
    }

    return .success(())
}
```

### Key Points
- ✅ Always pause before save/load operations
- ✅ Track previous state (running/paused)
- ✅ Restore previous state after operation
- ✅ Thread-safe memory access
- ✅ No more crashes!

    static let streetFighter2Cheats: [CheatCodeManager.CheatCode] = [...]

    // Get cheats by game name
    static func getCheats(for gameName: String, gameType: GameType) -> [CheatCodeManager.CheatCode]

    // Import all cheats for a game
    static func importCheats(for game: Game, to manager: CheatCodeManager) -> Int

    // Check if game has built-in cheats
    static func hasBuiltInCheats(for game: Game) -> Bool
}
```

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

### "No cheats available for this game"
**Cause:** Game name doesn't match cheat database entries

**Solution:** Check game name detection
```swift
// In CheatDatabase.swift, add detection for your ROM name:
if normalizedName.contains("street fighter") ||
   normalizedName.contains("sf2") ||
   normalizedName.contains("street fighter ii") {
    return streetFighter2Cheats
}
```

### Cheat doesn't work
**Possible causes:**
1. Wrong memory address for ROM version
2. Cheat needs to be applied continuously
3. ROM has anti-cheat protection

**Solutions:**
- Try different cheat codes for your ROM version
- Ensure cheat is toggled ON
- Check CheatCodeManager timer is running

### Save state still crashes
**If crash persists:**
1. Check emulator core state before operation
2. Add logging to track state transitions
3. Verify file permissions for save directory
4. Check available disk space
